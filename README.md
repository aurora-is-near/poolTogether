# Pool Together

**Summary:**

This project allows users to participate in a "lottery" with no downside.

Specifically, users can pool together their aurora tokens into a smart contract, 
this smart contract will stake these tokens on the aurora jetStaking contract for a 
specificied amount of time. After the specified amount of time has past, a winner 
is elected at random who will receive the yield generated by all the combined aurora.
All users will then receive their initial aurora investment.
